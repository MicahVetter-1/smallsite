                <p>Leon Bridges is an American Soul singer songwriter from Fort Worth, Texas. Growing up in a split family, Bridges developed a very shy and sheepish personality at a very young age. Due to his low-confidence, he was not aware of his musical tallent until his early adult years where he learned to play the guitar at a local community college. As he began to develop his music style, many fans compared him to Sam Cooke- an American soul singer in the 50's. For several years, Leon's career was at a standstill, with him only attracting 20 people to his shows at a time. His big break came when Austin Jenkins sat in on his performance of "Coming Home". It was this song that catapulted Leon into stardom.  </p></div>

                <p>Leon has a very unique style. His look mashes up vintage pieces with things sourced from the '80s and '90s—he's got a freewheeling, omnivorous vibe. At first many people thought that his style wasn't a real depiction of him as a person. However, Leon says, "I think people now are seeing that it's authentic." His inspirations run deep: The singer was moved to start dressing the way he does after he discovered Street Etiquette, the avant-garde style blog founded and run by Joshua Kissi and Travis Gumbs.   </p></div>

                <p>Over the years, Leon Bridges has had several successful collaborations with fellow artists and singers. Perhaps the most well-known collaboration was with Luke Combs. Luke and Leon have now released two recordings from the performance: Luke’s “Beautiful Crazy” featuring Leon, and Leon’s “Beyond” featuring Luke. Since then, Leon has worked with artists such as Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.   </p></div>
